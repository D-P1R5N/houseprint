# houseprint

Houseprint! A local Flask server to manage your home resources in real time.
  Never again will we worry about leaving the grocery store without something necessary.
  Never again do you wonder what you'll have for dinner, or what procedure you'll need to follow. 
  This is not intended currently to be professionally deployed, however it should still strive for best practices. 
  
  Step one: Begin by creating a user(s). Everyone in your house should access this program. There will be an option
    later to create an anonymous user later. 
    
  Step two: Start by creating the database. Scanning barcodes and going through the process of entering data is so
    boring, but we'll try our best to make it stream lined. There may be updates in the future to extract text
    from photo data allowing much swifter transactions.
    
  Step three: Just track what you use as you use it. The intended action is through an application interface,
    but later we will try other options, such as a recipe use query.
    
  Step four: The program tracks what you have, so if you're out and about, you can check the server. What's for dinner?
    Server makes suggestions based on what you've got currently. Do I have {blank}? Based on what you've bought and what 
    you've used, (yes/no). 
    
   Step five: Now we get into better things. Take that receipt and scan it, the program will create a log of the receipt.
    That's cool, now we can start to see what we can learn from your buying history. We can see price history, frequency,
    usage.
